# Pacemaker
Pacemaker model designed through Simulink and code generation to flash onto a NXP FRDM K64 board, which then interfaces with an artificial heart.  
The DCM then interfaces with the pacemaker to monitor and update parameters, such as refractory period and hysteresis.    
Current operating modes include AOO, AAI, VVO, and VVI modes.
